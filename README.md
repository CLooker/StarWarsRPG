This is a Star Wars desktop web-app game.

You will be given 4 characters to choose. You choose your character by clicking on their image.

You will then be given 3 enemies to choose. You choose your enemy by clicking on their image.

You are now prepared to battle!

By clicking the 'Attack' button, you will commence the battle. You will be given stats on the effect of the attack each time you click. Sometimes you will inflict damage upon your enemy, while at other times your enemy will inflict damage on you. This can continue until either your health or your enemy's health reaches 0.

Different characters have stronger attack-potential than others. When the characters/enemies are presented, the characters/enemies are ordered by attack-potential from left-to-right. Wedge is the weakest character and Boba Fett is the weakest enemy. Yoda is the strongest character and Darth Vader is the strongest enemy.

If you win your battle, you can click another enemy to fight, and repeat the process. Your health will be reset to 100 each round.

If you lose a battle, the game is over. But, you can start over by clicking 'Play Again'.
